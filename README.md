# SHP Buddy
SHP Buddy is a QGIS plugin that provides an quick and intuitive method for generating shapefiles for common plant breeding experiment designs. SHP Buddy lays out plots in a serpentine pattern and can account for fill plots and wheel tracks. Plot sizes are adjustable to exclude things such as adjacent plots and alleyways from the regions of interest. SHP Buddy provides an easy method for integrating field book information such as line names, pedigrees, and trait notes into the final shapefile for convenient identification and viewing. SHP Buddy works out-of-the-box in QGIS and does not require additional package or script installations.
